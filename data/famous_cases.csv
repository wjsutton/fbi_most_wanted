11,https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/willie-sutton,"Willie Sutton acquired two nicknames, ""The Actor"" and ""Slick Willie,"" for his ingenuity in executing robberies in various disguises. Fond of expensive clothes, Sutton was described as being an immaculate dresser. Although he was a bank robber, Sutton had the reputation of a gentleman; in fact, people present at his robberies stated he was quite polite. One victim said witnessing one of Sutton's robberies was like being at the movies, except the usher had a gun. When asked why he robbed banks, Sutton simply replied, ""Because that's where the money is."""
30,https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/gerhard-arthur-puff,"The robbers gained entry to the bank at approximately 8:05 a.m. by forcing an employee to open the front door. While one of the outlaws herded bank employees into a reception room located near the front of the bank and stood guard over them with what was described as a M1-type carbine, the other bandit made the cashier open the vault. The loot was collected in a muslin bag resembling a pillowcase and bearing the printing of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Missouri."

But within a few years, they'd be as wanted as any of the gun-slinging bank robbers of the gangster era.

Their names were Albert Nussbaum and Bobby Wilcoxson, and before they were locked away for good, they'd robbed eight banks, accumulated a massive arsenal of weapons, murdered a bank guard, and set off several bombs in the nation's capital."

295,https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/billie-austin-bryant,"On November 3, 1969, at 9:30 a.m., Judge Gerhard Gesell told Billie Austin Bryant that he ""would die in jail, but at the time God so appoints."" A jury in Washington, D.C., had found Bryant guilty of two counts of first degree murder in the brutal slaying of two FBI agents. The jury had been unable to agree on a sentence, and this responsibility was placed on the U.S. District Court judge.

On August 23, 1968, Bryant had escaped from the District of Columbia Department of Corrections Reformatory at Lorton, Virginia, by crashing an automobile through a chain link gate in a temporary fence. He had been working on the vehicle in the automobile shop."
436,https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/world-trade-center-bombing-1993,"On February 26, 1993, at about 17 minutes past noon, a thunderous explosion rocked lower Manhattan.

The epicenter was the parking garage beneath the World Trade Center, where a massive eruption carved out a nearly 100-foot crater several stories deep and several more high. Six people were killed almost instantly. Smoke and flames began filling the wound and streaming upward into the building. Those who weren't trapped were soon pouring out of the building-many panic-stricken and covered in soot. More than a thousand people were hurt in some way, some badly, with crushed limbs."

456,https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/911-investigation,"They were the most lethal terrorist attacks in history, taking the lives of 3,000 Americans and international citizens and ultimately leading to far-reaching changes in anti-terror approaches and operations in the U.S. and around the globe.

Our ensuing investigation of the attacks of 9/11-code-named ""PENTTBOM""-was our largest investigation ever. At the peak of the case, more than half our agents worked to identify the hijackers and their sponsors and, with other agencies, to head off any possible future attacks. We followed more than half-a-million investigative leads, including several hundred thousand tips from the public. The attack and crash sites also represented the largest crime scenes in FBI history."
